	<!-- 
	Purpose: test your jquery skills
	
	Instruction:
	
	1. Create a HTML section with a title, div containing paragraph of text (random text)
	
	2. Create a small form in html below the section above with one input text only.
	
	3. Add a submit button.
	
	4. Write jasvascript using jquery which will do the following:
	
	- Code will fire on form submit
	
	- Prevent the form from submitting as usual (prevent the post method on same page)
	
	- Get the value entered in the input field.
	
	- Make the div and the title above the form fade away (300ms)
	
	- Add the value you got from the input field above the form, wrapping it in a h1 tag and have the text color red.
	
	- Finally disable the button (not hidden but disabled)
	
	Extra points: validate the input to make sure it is not empty.
